    <h1>Paragraph 3</h1>
    <p>
      probably cuz i’m not fully here but i just want to say some stuff that’s been on my mind, i told you that you have my whole heart. and i mean that. i want you with my whole heart, i want to treat you how you’ve never been treated. 

In one of the questions yesterday or whenever it was “When did you almost say “i love you” but stopped?” i wanted to answer but i couldn’t truthfully but my answer would be that more and more recently i have wanted to say it, this doesn’t mean i will because i guess im waiting, this just explains how ive felt and how much my feelings for you have grown and become more vivid to me. i forever want you to know i will be here to adore you, to adore the steps you take, to adore the words you say, to adore everything you do.

i want you to know i truly miss you day in a day out, to me there not just words i say often, their words that deeply mean something, i have never once missed someone as dearly as i miss you. you don’t ever evade my thoughts, the key part of my thoughts every day involves you, i don’t wake up without thinking about you, i don’t go through my day without thinking about you, i don’t fall asleep without thinking about you. the words actually mean how i feel about you and how i want you to know that i can never stop thinking about the woman i adore.

I think most days about how i dont ever want to mess things up with you because you are unknowingly what ive been looking for, when we first met, i wasn’t “searching” for anything never mind a girl who makes me “yearn” for her day in and day out and makes me want to spend every second awake with her. my biggest fear with you is losing you or making you ever even have feeling of dislike or any negative feeling towards or about me.

i think with you i get excited on what the future may hold, some days i may or may not have feelings of impatience but i will forever be patient with you and respect everything and anything to do with you. 

AND i feel like today with the “dumb thing” you over thought which is no where near dumb, annoyed me because i just never want you to 1 think that anything you think about is dumb and 2 to ever feel like  i wont sit and listen or respond however you want me to to what you may feel. i just didn’t like the fact that it was something to do with me you were overthinking because i want you to always feel like there’s nothing to overthink because i make how i feel and everything i think about you pretty clear, but of course there will always be times we both overthink which i understand and why i don’t like to push to get “it out of you” .
