  <h1>Paragraph 1</h1>
  <p>Over the 69 days, i have enjoyed every moment we’ve spent talking, hanging out and even arguing after looking back (cuz without the few arguments we might not be how we are) . and like i just wanna thank you for being around and becoming a person im close to (even though you don’t like the thought of being close to people lol) and no matter what we are or ever will be, i will still forever and ever thank and appreciate you. Even though i may annoy you (and you don’t admit it but i think i do sometimes) or like be dryy i want you to know i never purposefully do anything to try and “push you away” or jeopardise anything we have. Like everyday i get excited or happy just to talk to you, and i look forward for days we get to hang out, no matter what we do aslong as i get to be with you i enjoy it! Even just talking to you like we did before we both fell asleep lmfao makes me happy. Sometimes i don’t think you realise how much i actually enjoy to be in your presence and company, and as i said i think i see you differently to how you see yourself as i see you as a supportive, caring, kind and all round great person no matter how sometimes you may try hide it. 🤍</p>
  <p>Yours sincerely - Your Sonetti Boy</p>
