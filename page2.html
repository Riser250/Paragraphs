    <h1>Paragraph 2</h1>
    <p>
      But whatever and whatever happens, i want you to know that don’t ever settle for less than what i’ve shown or even double (lol) of what i’ve shown. You as a person may deny your true self but i have seen and experienced how much of an amazing genuine supportive caring (somewhat lol) affectionate person always willing to put everything especially for me in-front of what you want and i hope you know as much as i show and try tell you how i feel for you, everything i ever do or say i mean it with my whole heart and as a person i am so so lucky to have gotten to know you and to be close with you. Everyday i think i’m lucky and am curious what i did to ever deserve you and to get the daily pleasure of me getting and choosing to be nice and kind and to care for you every single day no matter what. I truly believe you are a great person who i adore and it doesn’t ever matter what happens between us, i will always and i mean always be there for you! Some of this sounds like i see us stop talking in the future, but if i’m being honest i want and see the complete opposite, i want us to continue talking and for me to continue getting to be close to you every single day.
