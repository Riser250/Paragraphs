    <p>
      i enjoyed talking to you today so let me do this again.

As the more time passes i still can’t believe that i met you over A TDM like how has this happened, i sat doing tdm day in day out never meaning to find someone i would do anything for. I want you to know how much i really do appreciate you and value you. You are such an amazing person who honestly deserves the world and all the kindness in it.

We spent a lot of time last night talking and i really thought it was productive and i want you to know that every word i spoke was true. I want you. Everything about you i want. In my eyes your mine but by label not yet and as i said i would wait forever for you to be ready as-long as you reassure me I’m still what and who you want. I also want you to understand i do actually want you like for realsies with my whole heart. You mean the world to me and i want you to be all mine. I have thought about the distance with you and i can confidently say for me that is not a worry and for you i could be on a different planet and i would still want and adore you.

I never thought that one woman could make such an impact on me to the point where all i do is think about her like for instance when i hear the song Sweater Weather i think about the time she told me she did a performance of it in high school but wouldn’t look for the video to show me. Or whenever i see sea life it makes me think of her and the first time she told me about the shark facts and i was lucky enough to sit there and listen. Even just to star signs if they are mentioned it takes me back to the time we spent hours sat talking about them ON THE FIRST DAY WE MET. And i knew ever since the day i could listen to a girl and just be happy there i knew she was the one i wanted.

I think about you and can just sit there and smile, there is no other woman that i can imagine ever competing with you. The way i adore and obsess over you is unmatched and something i have never experienced before. Just hearing about your past experiences and the ways you’ve been treated, that alone makes me want to treat you better. I don’t know why you can never escape my mind, i can’t sleep most nights because i’m thinking of you and obsessing over you because of how much i adore you.

There’s sometimes we can be talking and all i want to say is that i love you, and it’s hard to not say it, i will probably end up slipping up and saying it earllyyyy soon because of how much i just want to just yell it at you and tell you all about it. I think i adopted the word “adore” as a replacement of it and so i can wait to say it. But i really really hope the day you’re ready you literally just yell it at me no matter what’s going on.

Sometimes, thinking about me going of as a water boy worries me too as i never want to stop talking to you, and as i have said i will continue to forever try with you until you are done, no matter what situation i’m ever in in life with the water boy i will always try with you. 

i still can’t get over how obsessed i am with you, and i feel so lucky to be able to be obsessed over you, all my feelings towards you are a gift i will never be deserving of and i have no idea how to explain what i ever did to be lucky enough for you to express similar feelings. Each and every day and night i smile at my phone talking to you, i laugh with you, im happy with you. Every night i look forward for the next day to be able and talk and hang out with you, and i loveeeeee the fact that i get to hang out with you.

    <p>Yours sincerely - Your Sonetti Boy</p>
